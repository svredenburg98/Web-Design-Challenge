# Web-Design-Challenge

In this project I created a website to display and describe visualizations on city weather. I created an index page with a summary and links to each visualization page, as well as a navbar which also links to the visualization pages and to a comparison and data page. I used a combination of bootstrap and my own CSS to style the pages.
